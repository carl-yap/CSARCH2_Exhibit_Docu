## S11 Group 9
For our exhibit, our group chose to explore **the history of handheld gaming consoles**. We
featured devices from the past such as the Nintendo Game & Watch and the original Nintendo Game Boy
and compared their displays to the handhelds we have today such as the Steam Deck. We plan to highlight what features 
or events related to these devices made them so popular, within the context of when they were
released and compared to their “relatives” from older periods in time.
